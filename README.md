## Getting Started (Local Testing)

To run locally, clone the repository, navigate into the root of the repository and run the command **"sh setup.sh"** to install the dependencies and create a .env file in the backend folder. It will be empty, you must add the following lines into the .env and fill them with the desired variables.

 - PORT=</port number/>
 - DB_FILE=</Desired database location/>
 - JWT_SECRET=</generate a strong secret/>
 - JWT_EXPIRES_IN=</How long untill the JWT (JSON Web Token) Should expire (in Milliseconds) />
 - SCHEMA=</custom_schema_name/>

Then navigate into the backend directory and run **"sh reset-db.sh"** to load the demo data. Next run **"npm start"** to start the backend database. Finally open a second terminal and navigate to the frontend directory and run **"npm start"** again to start up the frontend server, which can be accessed at the url **"http://localhost:</portNumber/>"**.

You will now be able to run the server anytime you run **"npm start"** in the backend folder and open a second terminal and run **"npm start"** in the frontend.
